# About the PolyZero Project

The statistics on humankind's rapidly increasing production, use, and disposal of single use plastics are shocking and depressing. Beyond the global ecological disaster posed by plastics dumped into oceans and landfills, plastics emit greenhouse gasses at each stage of their lifecycle exacerbating climate change. 

PolyZero is a web-app created to help consumers estimate the single-use plastics they consume in a year plus the CO2 footprint emitted from those plastics. 
The goal of our app is to raise awareness and provide advice and tools for reducing your plastic footprint. Beyond that, we provide a simple mechanism to purchase CO2 off-sets in order to reduce the climate impact of the plastics that consumers are unable to immediately eliminate from their lives.
