                The plastic pollution crisis overwhelming our oceans is also a
                significant and growing threat to the Earth’s climate. Nearly
                every piece of plastic begins as a fossil fuel, and greenhouse
                gasses are emitted at each stage of the plastic lifecycle:

                At current levels, greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic
                lifecycle threaten the ability of the global community to keep
                global temperature rise below 1.5°C degrees. By 2050, the
                greenhouse gas emissions from plastic could reach over 56
                gigatons—10-13 percent of the entire remaining carbon budget. If
                plastic production and use grow as currently planned, by 2030,
                these emissions could reach 1.34 gigatons per year—equivalent to
                the emissions released by more than 295 new 500-megawatt
                coal-fired power plants. By 2050, the cumulation of these
                greenhouse gas emissions from plastic could reach over 56
                gigatons—10–13 percent of the entire remaining carbon budget. In
                2019, the production and incineration of plastic will produce
                more than 850 million metric tons of greenhouse gasses—equal to
                the emissions from 189 five-hundred-megawatt coal power plants.
                On average, the production of one ton of plastic resin will emit
                1.89 Mt CO2e. When the differing emission profiles in the US and
                Europe are taken into account, producing a ton of PE will
                release 1.675 Mt CO2e; PP, 1.55 Mt; PET, 2.275 Mt; PVC.

              “With little notice nationally, a new petrochemical and plastics
              manufacturing hub may be taking shape along 300 miles of the upper
              reaches of the Ohio River, from outside Pittsburgh southwest to
              Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky. It would be fueled by a natural
              gas boom brought on by more than a decade of hydraulic fracturing,
              or fracking, a drilling process that has already dramatically
              altered the nation’s energy landscape—and helped cripple coal. But
              there’s a climate price to be paid. Planet-warming greenhouse gas
              emissions from the Shell plant alone would more or less wipe out
              all the reductions in carbon dioxide that Pittsburgh, just 25
              miles away, is planning to achieve by 2030. Drilling for natural
              gas leaks methane, a potent climate pollutant; and oil consumption
              for petrochemicals and plastics may account for half the global
              growth in petroleum demand between now and 2050.”

              A new study finds on average people could be ingesting
              approximately 5 grams of plastic every week, which is the
              equivalent weight of a credit card. The analysis No Plastic in
              Nature: Assessing Plastic Ingestion from Nature to People prepared
              by Dalberg, based on a study commissioned by WWF and carried out
              by University of Newcastle, Australia, suggests people are
              consuming about 2000 tiny pieces of plastic every week. That’s
              approximately 21 grams a month, just over 250 grams a year.

              There’s mounting evidence and growing concern about the impact of
              some plastic chemicals and plastic particles on human health.
              Scientists have established links between everyday exposure to
              chemical additives that leach from plastics and reproductive
              health issues, brain health, obesity, diabetes and some types of
              cancer. The effects are evident in babies, children, and adults –
              young and old. Microplastics – tiny particles of plastic under 5mm
              in length – are known to be in our air, soil, rivers, oceans,
              plants and animals. They are from degraded plastic products,
              textiles, tyre abrasion, industry, agriculture and general waste.
              Microplastics are also intentionally added to products, for
              example cosmetics. We know that microplastics get into our gut and
              lungs, but we don’t yet know how far they penetrate our blood and
              organs nor what impacts they have on human health. Concerningly,
              neither do we know how far the smaller virus-sized nanoparticles
              penetrate our bodies because we do not have suitable techniques to
              measure them. What we do know is that plastic is devastating our
              oceans, freshwater and land ecosystems that are essential for all
              life.
