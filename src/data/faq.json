    "Carbon credits are sold by the metric tonne of CO2. Our calculators assume a market price of JPY5000 per tonne. As the market price per tonne may fluctuate, there is a possibility we will offset a smaller number than is listed on the checkout screen. However, we anticipate that in most cases we should be able to offset a higher volume than what is promised. As credits are purchased details will be shared on this page so you can see specifically which projects are being supported."

As the project grows, we may consider applying a fraction of funds raised toward hosting. If this becomes the case, we commit to sharing expense data transparently."
