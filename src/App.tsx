          If you've seen a picture of the great Pacific Garbage Patch then you
          already know that plastic waste is a huge problem for the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the problem is not limited to plastic waste; the creation,
          transportation, and even the process of recycling plastic all emit
          huge amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.

          As consumers the most important steps we can take involve reducing the
          amount of single-use plastics we consume. Steps such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Always taking your own bags to the grocery store.</li>
          <li>Using reusable bottles or tumblers for drinks.</li>
          <li>Eliminating the use of plastic straws.</li>
        </ul>
        That said, depending on where you live, it may be extremely difficult to
        eliminate plastic completely. In that case, one way we can reduce our
        environmental impact is by of-setting our emissions.
        <p>
          <b>PolyZero</b> was created to help consumers calculate the CO2
          footprint emitted from single-use plastics and off-set the emissions.
